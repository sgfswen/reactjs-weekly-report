It's still a work in progress, but hopefully you can see where we're headed.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\nWe recommend that you get started with the [React Library](http://facebook.github.io/react/) before diving into material-ui for a better understanding. Should you choose to skip this, don't worry, we'll explain relevant React concepts as they come along.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nMaterial-UI is available as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.org/package/material-ui).\r\n```sh\r\nnpm install material-ui\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse [browserify](http://browserify.org/) and [reactify](https://github.com/andreypopp/reactify) for dependency management and JSX transformation. The CSS framework is written in [Less](http://lesscss.org/), so you'll need to compile that as well. For [Sass](http://www.sass-lang.com) users, [material-ui-sass](https://github.com/gpbl/material-ui-sass) contains the .scss version of the Less framework. People working with [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) can use [material-ui-stylus](https://github.com/Autarc/material-ui-stylus) to import\r\nthe proper .styl version of the files.\r\n\r\n### React-Tap-Event-Plugin\r\nSome components use [react-tap-event-plugin](https://github.com/zilverline/react-tap-event-plugin) to\r\nlisten for touch events. This dependency is temporary and will go away once react v1.0 is released. Until then, be\r\nsure to inject this plugin at the start of your app.\r\n```js\r\nvar injectTapEventPlugin = require(\"react-tap-event-plugin\");\r\n\r\n//Needed for onTouchTap\r\n//Can go away when react 1.0 release\r\n//Check this repo:\r\n//https://github.com/zilverline/react-tap-event-plugin\r\ninjectTapEventPlugin();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Roboto Font\r\nBe sure to include the [Roboto](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto) font in your project.\r\nHere are [some instructions](http://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Roboto:400,300,500) on how to include it in your project.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nOnce material-ui is included in your project, you can use the components this way:\r\n```js\r\n/** MyAwesomeReactComponent.jsx */\r\n\r\nvar React = require('react'),\r\n  mui = require('material-ui'),\r\n  RaisedButton = mui.RaisedButton;\r\n\r\nvar MyAwesomeReactComponent = React.createClass({\r\n\r\n  render: function() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <RaisedButton label=\"Default\" />\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n\r\n});\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = MyAwesomeReactComponent;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Customization\r\n\r\nThe styles are separated into 2 less files:\r\n* src/less/scaffolding.less\r\n* src/less/components.less\r\n\r\nThis allows you to override any variables defined in [custom-variables.less](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/blob/master/src/less/variables/custom-variables.less) without having to modify material-ui source files directly. For example, your main.less file could look something like this:\r\n```less\r\n@import \"node_modules/material-ui/src/less/scaffolding.less\";\r\n\r\n//Define a custom less file to override any variables defined in scaffolding.less\r\n@import \"my-custom-overrides.less\";\r\n\r\n@import \"node_modules/material-ui/src/less/components.less\";\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\nThere are 2 projects that you can look at to help you get started. The first project can be found in the [example folder](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/tree/master/example). This is a basic project that shows how you can consume material-ui components in your own project.\r\n\r\nThe second project is the actual documentation site. This is a more complex project but will give examples of every component. Check out the [docs folder](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/tree/master/docs) for build instructions.\r\n\r\n## Contribute\r\n\r\n[Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/) came about from our love of [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Google's Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html). We're currently using it on a project at [Call-Em-All](https://www.call-em-all.com/) and plan on adding to it and making it better. If you'd like to help, check out the [docs folder](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/tree/master/docs). We'd greatly appreciate any contribution you make. :)\r\n\r\n## License\r\nThis project is licensed under the terms of the [MIT license](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/blob/master/LICENSE)\r\n",
